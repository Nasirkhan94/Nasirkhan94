## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Nasir 
### I am a wireless communications researcher
I graduated with a Ph.D. degree from  KoÃ§ University Istanbul, where I was acting as a PhD rsearcher and member of the Wireless Networks Laboratory  ([WNL](https://wnl.ku.edu.tr/)). My work lies at the intersection of wireless communications, machine learning, and explainable AI, with a focus on building robust and interpretable deep learning solutions for next-generation wireless systems.

I earned my bachelors degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), Pakistan, in 2017.

Outside of research, I enjoy traveling, swimming, and cooking. Feel free to explore my repositories or connect with me for collaborations!
